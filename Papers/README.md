## Functional Dissection of the Enhancer Repertoire in Human Embryonic Stem Cells

#### Novel Points
* Authors use a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and a massively parallel reporter assay to identify functional enhancers in primed and naive human embryonic stem cells.

* We find that TF binding is linked with enhancer activity, in line with recent reports (Kwasnieski et al., 2014; Ernst et al., 2016; Kheradpour et al., 2013), but that no individual TF, histone mark or combination thereof could unequivocally predict enhancer activity.

* Our study identified a previously unrecognized group of functional enhancers that are active in ESCs but are associated with generic cell processes. This extended enhancer module is characterized by reduced binding of pluripotency- associated TFs and histone marks. This reduced binding might have placed these regions below the detection threshold in pre- vious ChIP-seq-based studies that lacked a functional readout.

#### Learned biological concepts
* Enhancer function requires transcription factor (TF) binding and corre- lates with histone modifications.
* Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) 
* with self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) compact, non-mammalian genomes can be quantitatively screened for enhancer activity by cloning randomly sheared DNA between a minimal-promoter-driven GFP open reading frame and a downstream polyA sequence.
