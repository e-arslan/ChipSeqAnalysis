## Functional Dissection of the Enhancer Repertoire in Human Embryonic Stem Cells

#### Novel Points
* Authors use a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and a massively parallel reporter assay to identify functional enhancers in primed and naive human embryonic stem cells.

#### How can I use for my further analysis?


#### Available data

#### Learned biological concepts
* Enhancer function requires transcription factor (TF) binding and corre- lates with histone modifications.


#### Biological terms
primed cell : 
antigen : 
naive human embryonic stem cells :
